This is a blog containing a mixture of expository articles on selected machine learning topics and implementations of projects.

The primary function of writing this blog is to assist me in developing thorough understanding of topics in machine learning, statistics, data science, and algorithm analysis.

The secondary function is to allow me to explore my interests and more broadly, as a targetted way of getting through my ever-growing reading list of books - by writing book reviews.

If there are any guiding principles that motivate writing in this blog, it is an emphasis on clear communication.
